;;; cheatsheets --- Summary:
;; Inspired by a @hillelogram tweet, this is a tiny, quick and dirty minor mode
;; to enable you to use cheatsheets wherever and for whatever mode you wish.
;; The basic mode of operations is the following:
;; 1. Edit a file in `major-mode', want to look something up that you have almost certainly done in the past.
;; 2. Highlight your function/expression/thing, and press your bound hotkey.
;; 3. You are taken to `(concat user-emacs-directory "cheatsheets/" major-mode ".org")'
;; 4. If region was active, `swiper-isearch' for region content.
;;; Commentary:
;; This is extremely quick-and-dirty, but it does the job for me.  You can drop this into
;; your init folder and use it with `use-package' to load on startup:
;; (use-package cheatsheets :config (cheatsheets-mode))
;;
;; I'm bad at elisp so if you find this useful and have some improvements for it,
;; email me at mordecai at malignat.us and leave me a line or two.
